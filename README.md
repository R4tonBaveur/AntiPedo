# AntiPedo
This project has been done in order to find minors accounts in a twitter community posting mature content.
I do not take any responsability if someone uses it for any unentended usage.

# How to use it
To use it you will need first a twitter developper account, then create an app and pass the different creditentials in the config.json file.
Then to search suspects accounts, take a convicted account pass its twitter @ in the function parameter at the end in index.js (without the '@')
